# Yubaba

[View deployed site] (https://krisjowen.github.io/yubaba/index.html)

This site has been built as the first of four projects as part of my Code Insitute web development diploma. It is a website for a band that provides images and videos to showcase their work as well as a booking form for any interested clients to get in touch with them.


# UX

## Strategy

The user stories were defined as follows:

- As a site visitor, I want to be able to see details about the band and to contact them with details of any potential bookings.
- As the band, I want to show images of how we look and present a profile

The acceptance criteria were outlined as below:

- High quality image of band available
- Booking form in place
- Profile of band and its members
